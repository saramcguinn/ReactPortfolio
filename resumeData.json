A proud alumna of Northwestern, Sara studied abroad for a full year in Seville, Spain as an undergraduate and received her BA in Spanish. After completing her MA in Applied Linguistics at the University of Massachusetts Boston, she tutored Spanish and taught English as a second language (ESL) for several years before returning to Northwestern, this time as a staff member. Currently, she is part of the leadership team of International Educators of Illinois, where she co-coordinates the association's mentorship program. When not at work, she love spending time with her husband and kids, playing games, listening to live music, watching sports, reading...and of course, coding.",
